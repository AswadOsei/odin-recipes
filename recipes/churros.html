    <h1>The best Churros Recipe</h1>
    <img src="/images/churros500x375.webp" alt="Image of Churros">
    <p>We’ve all had those churros, the kind that come in a long uniform straight form, that were previously fried, frozen then reheated and they’re sitting there for hours next to the hot pretzels. 
        Every now and then you’ll come across one that’s okay, but most of the time no thanks.</p>
        <p>That’s because I’ve had real churros and nothing compares. Fresh homemade churros are the best out there!</p>
        <p>I’ve decided these need to be a new tradition for family parties. 
            I made these earlier this week for the blog then a few days later made them again for a family party and you would not believe how quickly they disappeared! 
            Definitely faster then I could fry them.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup (250ml) water</li>
                <li>1/4 cup (56g) unsalted butter, diced into small cubes</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp (13g) granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 cup (141g) all-purpose flour (scoop and level to measure)</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>For the coating whisk together 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon in a shallow dish, set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat about 1 1/2 inches vegetable oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium-high heat to 360 degrees Fahrenheit. While oil is heating prepare batter.</li>
                <li>Add water, butter, sugar and salt to a large saucepan, bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Add flour reduce heat to medium-low and cook and stir constantly with a rubber spatula until mixture comes together and is smooth (a few lumps in it are fine).</li>
                <li>Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl, let cool 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add vanilla and egg to flour mixture then blend immediately with an electric mixer. Blend until mixture comes together and is smooth (it will separate at first but keep mixing it will come together)./li>
                <li>Transfer to a 16-inch piping bag fitted with a rounded star tip (no bigger than 1/2-inch). I recommend using the Ateco 845 or 846.
                </li>
                <li>Carefully pipe mixture into preheated oil, into about 6-inch lengths, cut end with clean scissors.</li>

            </ol>
